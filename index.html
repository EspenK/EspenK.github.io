                <p class="ingress">EVE Online is a <span class="tooltip" title="massively multiplayer online role-playing game">MMORPG</span> that takes place in a space universe called New Eden.</p>
                <p class="byline">by <span class="author">Mark Konzin</span>, 2018-02-05</p>
                <p>One thing that separates it from other games is that the game takes place in a single, shared and persistent universe. What does this mean? It means that all players (except most Chinese players) are living and operating in the same world, fighting for the same resources and territories. There are (almost) no rules, other then those the players themselves enforce. Any player can go anywhere in the universe, unless someone decide they don't want to let you into their space, then will stop you.</p>
                <p>Since this is all happening in a shared world it allows the growth of huge player organisations working together for common goals. The social aspect of the game is very important and one of the keys to staying in the game.</p>
                <p>Another interesting aspect is that the market is player driven. All items (with few exceptions) are manufactured by players. And for this market to move forward, all items can be permanently lost in battle. When a ship explodes it is gone forever, you can however recover some of the modules from the wreck... but let's be honest, if you died the chances are your enemies won the battle and will take the loot for themselves and you are left with nothing. This leads to the number one rule in EVE: never fly what you can't afford to loose! I will repeat this later, don't worry.</p>
                <p>So now we have covered some basic principles that make the game unique. If it peaked your interest, please follow along as we tackle the basic mechanics and how to get started.</p>
