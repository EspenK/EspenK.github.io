            <h2>Roles in PvP</h2>
            <p class="ingress">A fleet have DPS ships, often called mainline ships, logistics, support and tackle.</p>
            <p class="byline">by <span class="author"></span>, date</p>
            <p>A DPS ships job is to deal damage to other ships. The fleet commander calls a target and all the pilots flying DPS fire their guns on that target. This is often considered the easiest role, but it is also the most needed (in amount of ships).</p>
            <p>A logistics ship is the "healer", and it's job is to repair other ships in the fleet. This is a very important role.</p>
            <p>Support ships can be many different things. You often want links, or boosters, that provide bonus stats to nearby ships in the same fleet. You also want ships that can webify (slow down), point (tackle at long range) and target paint.</p>
            <p>A tacklers job is to keep enemies from leaving the fight. Interdictors, T2 destroyer ships can deploy warp interdiction bubbles that prevent warping. Other tackle ships can be interceptors, T2 frigates, or heavy interdictors, T2 cruisers. A HIC (Heavy Interdictor Cruiser) can put bubbles up on themselves, or choose to scram or point a single ship with infinite point strength.</p>
