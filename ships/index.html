            <p>Each of the four Empire factions have a large amount of ships in all sizes and variations.</p>
            <p>There are different tech levels. Tech I, or T1, is the default type. These ships are usually set up in a way that allows the player to choose how to use it, as the slot layout and traits are pretty general. Tech II, or T2, are more specialised and their slot layout and traits heavily suggest you use them in a specific way. T2 ships are generally stronger, but only in their role and can often have trouble adapting like a T1 ship could. There are also some ships made by pirate factions. Those combine traits two empire factions, usually making them better then their empire counterparts. Faction ships are considered T1 even thought they are usually stronger.</p>
            <p>There are also different many different sizes, divided up in classes. A doctrine is a collection of ship types, each with their designated role.</p>
