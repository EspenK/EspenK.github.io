            <p class="byline">by <span class="author">Mark Konzin</span>, date 2018-02-20</p>
            <p>In late 2016 the <a href="https://updates.eveonline.com/date/2016-11-15/">Ascension</a> expansion introduced clone states. Currently there are two clone states, Alpha and Omega. Alpha is the free alternative with some limitations. Omega is the full subscriber state and grants access to all ships, modules, skills and mechanics in the game. In this guide we will focus more on the Alpha state and come back to Omega where it is needed.</p>
            <p>Alpha clones have limited skillsets, and some game mechanic restrictions, but in the <a href="https://updates.eveonline.com/date/2017-12-05/">Arms Race</a> expansion some of those limits were raised to allow more skills, and thereby ships and modules, to be used by Alphas. This means that with a free account you can not skill and fly all ships, but for a new or casual player there are more then enough options!</p>

            <p class="byline">by <span class="author">Mark Konzin</span>, date 2018-02-20</p>
            <p>There are four empire factions in the game. Which one you choose does not really matter, it is up to you who you like the backstory of more, or simply who you think looks coolest. All game mechanics are equal to every character, no matter whatever you choose. You start out with slightly different skills, but you can train those skills at any point. You can choose one faction but then immediately choose to skill for another factions ships. One other difference is the starting location, but this does not matter much either, as you can travel anywhere you like.</p>
            <p>So once you have made a character and chosen a name it is time to start the game and enter the starter mission.</p>

            <p class="ingress">Once you start the game after creating your character you are thrown into the starter mission where you have to save survivors from ship wrecks and defeat some NPC enemies.</p>
            <p class="byline">by <span class="author">Mark Konzin</span>, date 2018-02-20</p>
            <p>Your starter ship is a Rookie ship of whatever faction you choose. It has a gun and an <span class="tooltip" title="propulsion module"></span>afterburner. You get a transmission from your factions military academy saying you have been attacked along with other friendly ships and you have to save the survivors from ship wrecks. Here you learn to use some of the UI with help from the NPC co-pilot, Aurora, and tooltips and pop-up boxes in the UI.</p>
            <p>You will be attacked by some NPCs during this first mission, but fear not, they are weak and you can easily defeat them by following the tips from Aurora.</p>
            <p>Once you get out of the first mission you will learn to dock in a station and you will be rewarded for completing the mission. You get time to explore the UI a bit more and you now have the chance to start training some new skills. Once you feel ready you can head out to do some more missions.</p>
